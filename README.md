## To Do
- Good path finding (Avoid crash in absence of saddle when under or in the inventory of the horse) 
- KB 
- improve graphics 
- KB must contain: 
- position of object 
- ownership of object (saddle in horse mouth) 
- order of action (what to do, given a state) 
## Bugfixing
Number of taken carrots 
An uncrushed carrot 
Loop if multiple elements 
Already saddled pony 
No object crash 
Errors in KB
