% To translate into Prolog:
% Chance of succeeding a mounting action is: 5 * (exp level + steed tameness)
% cannot attempt to mount a steed if any of the following conditions apply:
% 
%     You are already riding.
%     You are hallucinating.
%     Your have wounded legs.
%     Your encumbrance is stressed or worse.
%     You are blind and not telepathic.
%     You are punished.
%     You or your steed are trapped.
%     You are levitating and cannot come down at will.
%     You are wearing rusty or corroded body armor.
% 
% You will always fail and slip if any of the following apply:[3]
% 
%     You are confused.
%     You are fumbling.
%     You have slippery fingers.
%     Your steed's saddle is cursed.
